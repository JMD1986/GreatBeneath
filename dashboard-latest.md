# üé¨ Master Screenplay Dashboard  
**Locked Version ‚Äî 2025-10-07**  

---

## Tone Thesis  
**Stage directions = Eggers-level density (folk, ritual, sensory).  
Dialogue = sparse, casual, occasionally silly (Coens/Cregger).  
Imagery = uncanny, both grotesque and absurd.  
Let the page feel Eggers, but let the people feel Coens.**
