# Motifs & Symbols

### Animals / Nature

* **Lizards:** Function as ubiquitous, uncanny watchers and guardians of the property's supernatural order. Their reptilian traits are later mirrored in the neighbors, revealing the true nature of the cul-de-sac's residents.
* **Cicadas / Bugs:** The drone of cicadas is a constant auditory motif of the oppressive Texas heat and rising tension. Other insects serve as physical manifestations of the house's encroaching corruption.
* **The Tree / Sapling:** The central symbol of the script, growing from the supernatural "Dream Seed". It grows at an unnatural rate and is the physical embodiment of the consuming entity.
* **Pollinators (Butterflies & Bees):** Initially represent Doug and Hailey's idyllic, hopeful dream for their home. The symbol is corrupted throughout the script, with the final "pollinator field" being the beautiful but terrifying result of their assimilation into the curse.

### Objects

* **White Stones (Hex Rocks):** The primary supernatural objects used as a protective boundary line. Doug's removal of them is the catalyst that awakens the entity.
* **Witch Bottles:** First appears as a cursed object that Doug breaks. The object is later co-opted by Hailey, who crafts her own versions to fight back, symbolizing her transformation.
* **The Purple Yarn Bracelet:** A piece of protective folk magic Hailey crafts. It symbolizes her love and magical protection over Doug.
* **The Dream Seed:** The physical manifestation of Doug's nightmare, which he naively plants. This single act allows the central monstrous entity to take root in their yard.
