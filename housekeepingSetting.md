# Setting & World

The primary setting is a single-family home on a quiet, unassuming cul-de-sac in South Austin, Texas. The world is presented as identical to our own, except for the specific supernatural entity tied to this piece of land.

* **The House & Yard:** The house is not just a location but an active antagonist. The yard is its primary weapon, a patch of Texas soil that is "wrong." It resists being tamed and ultimately becomes the site of sacrifice and rebirth.
* **The Mythology:** The supernatural "rules" are revealed slowly:
    * **The White Stones:** Wards that were placed to "quiet the soil" and suppress a darker force. Moving them awakens the entity.
    * **The Tree/Entity:** A powerful, ancient intelligence in the land that requires the "caretakers" of the home to be "bound to it." It consumes one partner and transforms them, a process it calls a "bloom."
    * **The Lizards:** Ambiguous figures that seem to serve the entity but also act as guardians or messengers. They appear when boundaries are crossed and seem to be protectors of the natural, albeit cursed, order.
    * **The Cycle:** This has happened before. The property follows a pattern, luring in couples, testing them, and ultimately consuming them to perpetuate its own existence.
