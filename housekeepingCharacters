# Character Breakdowns

### DOUG JONES (Late 30s)
[cite_start]A well-meaning, creative, and loving husband whose folksy charm and grand ideas are often a coping mechanism for his bipolar disorder[cite: 1]. [cite_start]He channels his energy into external projects, wanting to create a perfect "butterfly haven" for Hailey[cite: 1]. [cite_start]He is impulsive and can be naive, initially dismissing the supernatural signs as quirks of their new home[cite: 1]. His journey is one of being broken down and then remade by the house's influence. His manic energy is co-opted by the entity, but his fierce love for Hailey is ultimately what drives his final, sacrificial choice. [cite_start]He fights the house with brute force, tools, and eventually, acceptance[cite: 1].

### HAILEY JONES (Mid 30s)
[cite_start]Practical, organized, and deeply in love with Doug[cite: 1]. [cite_start]She is the planner, the one who relies on Martha Stewart, Pinterest, and logic to impose order on chaos[cite: 1]. [cite_start]Initially skeptical of anything supernatural, she is the emotional anchor of the relationship, patiently managing Doug's mental health while pursuing her own dreams of a perfect home[cite: 1]. [cite_start]When logic fails her, her resourcefulness and fierce protective instinct lead her to embrace folklore and ritual[cite: 1]. She fights the house with wards, research, and cunning. [cite_start]Her journey is a transformation from a modern homemaker into a powerful, self-reliant witch[cite: 1].

### OFFICER KLEIN (40s)
[cite_start]A stiff, procedural, but not unkind police officer[cite: 1]. [cite_start]He is the voice of grim history, aware of the strange pattern of disappearances at the Jones' address[cite: 1]. He has seen this before and is resigned to the strangeness of "weird Texas history". [cite_start]While he goes through the motions of official police work, he seems to know that the real problem is beyond his jurisdiction[cite: 1].

### OFFICER GABRUS (30s)
[cite_start]Klein's younger, sweeter, but dimmer partner[cite: 1]. [cite_start]He is more empathetic toward the Joneses, trying to offer genuine help through official channels (like domestic violence pamphlets) which are comically, and tragically, inadequate for the situation[cite: 1]. [cite_start]He represents the failure of the real world's systems to comprehend or combat the supernatural threat[cite: 1].

### LISA (40s) & ALLISON (40s)
[cite_start]The chain-smoking, mullet-rocking neighbors who serve as a cryptic Greek Chorus[cite: 1]. [cite_start]They have clearly witnessed the house's cycle before and have achieved a kind of cynical, detached peace with it[cite: 1]. [cite_start]Their warnings are always couched in deadpan, folksy observations ("It's always the men first."), making them all the more unsettling[cite: 1]. [cite_start]They represent a possible outcome: survival through non-interference[cite: 1].
