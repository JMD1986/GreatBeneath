# Tone & Style

* **Folk Horror:** Rooted in the specific folklore of its Texas setting, drawing on local legends (hex stones), flora, and fauna (lizards, cicadas) to create a unique sense of dread.
* **Domestic Dread:** The horror is juxtaposed with the mundane realities of moving, renovating, and living in a new home. The terror isn't just in the supernatural, but in the violation of the one place that should be a sanctuary.
* **Body Horror:** The script features visceral, Cronenberg-esque body horror, particularly in the climax where Hailey's body gruesomely transforms into a tree.
* **Darkly Comedic:** There is a vein of dark, deadpan humor throughout, found in the couple's banter, the cops' observations, and the absurdity of trying to apply mundane solutions (like Google Translate) to supernatural problems. The visual style is described through static, wide shots that create a voyeuristic, oppressive atmosphere, making the characters feel trapped by their environment.
