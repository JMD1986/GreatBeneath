# Themes

* [cite_start]**The Horrors of Homeownership:** The script uses the supernatural as a powerful metaphor for the real-world anxieties of buying a first home: unexpected costs, endless labor, the feeling that the house owns you, and the strain it puts on a relationship[cite: 1].
* **Love and Sacrifice:** The core of the story is the couple's promise to "fight the house, not ourselves." [cite_start]Every trial they face is a test of their bond[cite: 1]. [cite_start]The climax is the ultimate expression of this theme: Doug's choice to be consumed by the curse rather than live without Hailey is a terrifying but profound act of love[cite: 1].
* [cite_start]**The Blurring Line Between Mental Illness and the Supernatural:** The script cleverly uses Doug's bipolar disorder as a lens through which the supernatural events are initially filtered[cite: 1]. Is his mania a symptom of his illness, or is the house amplifying it? [cite_start]This ambiguity creates a grounded, psychological layer to the horror[cite: 1].
* [cite_start]**Ritual vs. Routine:** Hailey's journey from "housekeeping" to "warding" explores the idea that domestic routines are a form of modern ritual used to keep chaos at bay[cite: 1]. [cite_start]When her Pinterest-board world fails, she must turn to older, more powerful rituals to protect her home and family[cite: 1].
