# Synopsis

[cite_start]DOUG (late 30s) and HAILEY (mid 30s), a loving couple navigating the strains of Doug's bipolar disorder, finally purchase their first home in a quiet South Austin cul-de-sac[cite: 1]. [cite_start]Their dream is to fix it up in ten days for their 13th-anniversary party[cite: 1]. [cite_start]But from the moment they arrive, the house feels wrong[cite: 1]. [cite_start]They discover strange, hand-carved white stones lining the property, are watched by cryptic neighbors (LISA and ALLISON), and find a hidden, blighted "bonus yard" on their property[cite: 1].

[cite_start]Their attempts at "housekeeping" are met with escalating supernatural hostility[cite: 1]. [cite_start]Doug's efforts to tame the yard are manic and destructive, while Hailey's attempts to create a perfect home are thwarted by bugs, strange occurrences, and a growing sense of dread[cite: 1]. [cite_start]After Doug accidentally breaks a "witch bottle" hidden in the bonus yard, the house turns on them, culminating in a terrifying night where a man, seemingly possessed, has a violent episode in their backyard[cite: 1]. [cite_start]The encounter leaves Doug with a black eye and Hailey with a mysterious cut[cite: 1].

[cite_start]The police, KLEIN and GABRUS, are unhelpful, dismissing the event as a "tweaker episode" but hinting at a dark history at the address where previous residents have gone missing[cite: 1]. [cite_start]As Doug becomes more erratic, haunted by vivid nightmares of a giant, pulsating seed, Hailey's research into the stones reveals a local folklore about a powerful entity that binds the "caretaker" of the home to the soil[cite: 1].

[cite_start]The escalating horror climaxes when Doug, tilling the yard, unearths a skeletal hand[cite: 1]. [cite_start]The trauma triggers a psychotic break, and he is hospitalized[cite: 1]. [cite_start]Left alone, Hailey is tormented by the neighbors' warnings ("Some marriages end in divorce. These end in bloom.") and terrifying visions[cite: 1]. [cite_start]Realizing she cannot rely on conventional solutions, she embraces the very folklore she feared, crafting her own wards and witch bottles to fight back[cite: 1].

[cite_start]When Doug returns, they perform a ritual to confront the entity, but it's a trap[cite: 1]. [cite_start]The yard transforms into a liminal void, and Hailey is horrifically consumed by a supernatural tree that bursts from the ground, her body transforming into bark and branches[cite: 1]. [cite_start]In a final, desperate act of love, Doug eats the cursed fruit of the tree to join her, refusing to let her go[cite: 1].

[cite_start]The story ends with Doug and Hailey standing peacefully in a yard now miraculously transformed into a perfect pollinator garden[cite: 1]. [cite_start]They have found a serene, eternal harmony, but they are now the willing, unblinking guardians of the haunted property, bound together forever as the neighborhood dissolves into a supernatural void around them[cite: 1].
